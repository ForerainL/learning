Training and evaluation utilities for a time-series return prediction project. See
`docs/requirements.md` for the full data format, modeling, and evaluation
requirements.

## Quick start
- Review the data format and splits in `docs/requirements.md`.
- Use the training scripts in the repository (for example, `train.py` or
  `train_ddp.py`) to run experiments once data is prepared.
